HOW TO SHARE CODES FROM ECLIPSE TO GITHUB


1. Enter GITHUB and select the required repository where we want to PUSH the code

2. Open ECLIPSE ----> WINDOWS ----> SHOW VIEWS ---> OTHERS ---> GIT ---> GIT REPOSITORY ---> OK

3. Now we can able to see the GIT REPOSITORY tab some where on the screen depends on the ECLIPSE version that we are using

4. From that tab select CLONE A GIT REPOSITORY icon

5. Since we have copied the URL in step 1 all the detailes would have been automatically filled here so just click NEXT (GIVE AUTHENTICATION IF NEEDED)

6. Select the required branch and click NEXT

7. Click FINISH button

8. Now the code would have been moved to local repository (Which means it has not yet pushed to centralized repository)

9. From package explorer right click on the project what we want to push ---> Team ---> Share Project ---> Select GIT ---> Next ---> REPOSITORY : >>SELECT THE REQUIRED PROJECT<< ---> Finish 

10. Now in package explorer we can see question mark sympol (?) on the project what we are going to push  

11. Again right click on the project what we want to push ---> Team ---> Add to index

12. Now in package explorer we can see Plus sympol (+) or (*) on the project what we are going to push 

13.
